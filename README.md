**Hardik's PO/PM Portfolio Projects**
Welcome to the repository for my Product Owner/Product Manager (PO/PM) portfolio projects, developed with Shreyas Jondhale. This repo contains code, documentation, and assets for two initiatives:

Workday Email Notification Project: Addresses 73% of Northeastern students missing on-campus jobs due to no notifications (satisfaction 3.1/5). Solution: Daily Job Alerts via Workday, aiming to save 10–20 minutes weekly and boost applications by 30%. Includes a prototype toggle UI.
Ad Experience Optimization for Snapchat: Tackles ad complaints for Snapchat’s 460M DAUs (4,606 from 41,287 Google Play reviews). Proposes five solutions (Frequency Caps, Skippable Ads, etc.) to cut Story/Chat ad issues by 65%, targeting a $450M net revenue uplift with 100x ROI by 2025.
Explore the docs/ folder for proposals and PPTs, prototype/ for the Workday UI, and analysis/ for data insights. Contributions and feedback are welcome—contact Hardik Dave or Shreyas Jondhale. Last updated: June 07, 2025.
